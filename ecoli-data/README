Those files were downloaded from the Ensembl genomes website.

Each file corresponds to one Escherichia coli strain for which a complete or
draft genome sequence is available. The name of the strain were contained in
the original file names (see correspondence table below).

Each file contains the peptide sequences from all translations resulting from
Ensembl known or novel gene predictions for that given E. coli strain.

Files are in the FASTA format.
